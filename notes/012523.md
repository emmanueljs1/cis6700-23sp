Locally Nameless Tutorial (part II)
================================

Questions about `Lec1_full.v`
---------------------------

* What is the definition of `==`/`eq_dec`? What makes it decidable?

* Can you elaborate on the intuition for why `lc_abs_exists` holds?

* Would it be possible to discuss how the proof of `step_lc_exp2` works? I
wasn’t fully certain when we need to invoke the tactic “pick fresh x for L” in
a proof concerning local closure.

* What exactly is `exists-fresh`?


Questions about `Lec2_full.v`
---------------------------

Q for class: [Lec2.v, weakening] Not so much a question as a request — could
you go over in class why cofinite quantification is needed? I'm finding the
Coq proof state a little difficult to read and I think I'd appreciate seeing
it written out in regular math terms. I think it makes sense up to where the
context in weakening needs to be hypothesized to be equal to two appended
contexts, but then I'm not sure why the cofinite quantification would help
(not having actually done the exercise yet). It's especially mysterious since
it looks like the extra argument `L` in `typing_abs` doesn't actually do
anything for the abstraction aside from being a set that doesn't contain the
abstracted variable. Would it make sense when written down in a derivation
rule, or is this purely an artifact of locally nameless?

Would the proof of weakening be any simpler if you defined a partial order on
contexts (G1 <= G2 iff every x : t in G1 is included in G2) and proved that
the typing relation respects this order?

General questions
-----------------

* With the help of a tool like LNGen, what is the main pain point of working
  with LN variable representations?
  
* For CIS6700, my question is: a lot of the other questions ask about how LN
  compares to de Bruijn representations; can we go over what that is?  Also,
  the lecture mentions that the strategy of only working with closed terms
  breaks down when you start doing compiler optimizations; I don't really
  understand how LN with open fixes this.
