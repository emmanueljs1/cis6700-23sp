Locally Nameless Tutorial
-------------------------

Tutorial location: https://github.com/plclub/metalib/tree/master/Stlc 

Pre-class instructions: Please install metalib, read over the tutorial
material and send me questions before class. You don't need to to the
exercises --- just identify questions that you want to discuss in depth.

Questions about Definitions.v / Stlc.v
----------------------

* Why the particular representation of free vars in `var_f`?

* My question is about `open_exp_wrt_exp_rec` in the `Stlc.v` file and what is its
obligation with regard to open nominal variables.  So would 
`open_exp_wrt_exp <{ \x. Y x }> <{ Y }>` cause a capture of Y?

Or is the contract that only locally closed terms can be opened wrt exp?

* I’m also confused about the definition `open_exp_wrt_exp_rec`. I’ve read the
  description above that definition in Definitions.v, however I still don’t
  get why we want to do` var_b (n - 1)` when getting at the case `inright _`. I
  don’t know what I’m missing, but can you please clarify this for me?


Questions about Lec1_full.v
---------------------------

* Can you elaborate on how locally nameless representations differ from other
  de Bruijn representations? How would the free variables be represented in
  the latter?

* What is the definition of `==`/`eq_dec`? What makes it decidable?

* Where is the definition/explanation for `open_exp_wrt_exp`?

* In the Lemma `demo_open`, the left-hand side was `(app (abs (app …..)))` but
  inside had two bounded variables. I was wondering why this is the case
  because `(var_b 0)` seems to not match with any abs.

* The preamble to the `subst_exp_intro` lemma mentions how “opening can be
replaced with variable opening and substitution” — would you mind explaining
how opening in general and variable opening differ?

* Can you elaborate on the intuition for why `lc_abs_exists` holds?

* Would it be possible to discuss how the proof of `step_lc_exp2` works? I
wasn’t fully certain when we need to invoke the tactic “pick fresh x for L” in
a proof concerning local closure.

* What exactly is `exists-fresh`?


Project question
----------------
By the way, on the semester project, will we have a project proposal process
or should we try to get started once we find a suitable project? And what is
the recommendation on selecting from the course reading materials or should we
try to pick adjacent material not already included on the syllabus?
i.e. should we worry about coordinating the variety of subjects in the class?
A little more guideline/guidance on the project selection would be
appreciated.
