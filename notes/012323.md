Locally Nameless Tutorial
-------------------------

Tutorial location: https://github.com/plclub/metalib/tree/master/Stlc 

Pre-class instructions: Please install metalib, read over the tutorial
material and send me questions before class. You don't need to to the
exercises --- just identify questions that you want to discuss in depth.


Questions about Definitions.v / Stlc.v
----------------------

* Why the particular representation of free vars in `var_f`?

* My question is about `open_exp_wrt_exp_rec` in the `Stlc.v` file and what is its
obligation with regard to open nominal variables.  So would 
`open_exp_wrt_exp <{ \x. Y x }> <{ Y }>` cause a capture of Y?

Or is the contract that only locally closed terms can be opened wrt exp?

* I’m also confused about the definition `open_exp_wrt_exp_rec`. I’ve read the
  description above that definition in Definitions.v, however I still don’t
  get why we want to do` var_b (n - 1)` when getting at the case `inright _`. I
  don’t know what I’m missing, but can you please clarify this for me?


Questions about Lec1_full.v
---------------------------


* What is the definition of `==`/`eq_dec`? What makes it decidable?

* Where is the definition/explanation for `open_exp_wrt_exp`?

* In the Lemma `demo_open`, the left-hand side was `(app (abs (app …..)))` but
  inside had two bounded variables. I was wondering why this is the case
  because `(var_b 0)` seems to not match with any abs.

* The preamble to the `subst_exp_intro` lemma mentions how “opening can be
replaced with variable opening and substitution” — would you mind explaining
how opening in general and variable opening differ?

* Can you elaborate on the intuition for why `lc_abs_exists` holds?

* Would it be possible to discuss how the proof of `step_lc_exp2` works? I
wasn’t fully certain when we need to invoke the tactic “pick fresh x for L” in
a proof concerning local closure.

* What exactly is `exists-fresh`?

General questions
-----------------

* Can you elaborate on how locally nameless representations differ from other
  de Bruijn representations? How would the free variables be represented in
  the latter?

* What is the difference between the locally nameless representation and de
  Brujin indices? Definitions.v clarifies that our bound variables are indeed
  an implementation of de Brujin indices, but Lec1.v seems to suggest that
  these are different approaches


* The tutorials went over some of the peculiarities of working with LN
  variable representations when it comes to substitution, progress and
  preservation. Are there analogous peculiarities when you try to work with
  logical relations with LN?

* With the help of a tool like LNGen, what is the main pain point of working
  with LN variable representations?


* What would interpreting this language look like when there are no values of
  the base type? I am curious as interpreting felt like a main motivation for
  still having free variables

* On the topic on variable binding, one peculiar way I’ve seen someone deal
  with it is by introducing explicit syntax for the structural rules, and
  doing away altogether with variable names.

  I saw Dominic Orchard do it once in a small Haskell file
  (https://gist.github.com/dorchard/aeec2274dcd4c9c7233e5c39d86343a3). Essentially
  looks like this…

  You would represent (\x.\y.x) as (\lam.\lam.weakening(var)).
  You would represent (\x.\y.y) as (\lam.\lam.var).

  From what I understand the trick is that by convention the generic “var”
  variable simply refers to the rightmost thing in the context by convention. So
  if you want “var” to refer to anything else you use explicit structural rules
  to move the intended referent in the rightmost place in the context.

  I know you can’t cover all the pros/cons of various approaches but if you
  have time I’ve always been curious about what the pros/cons are for this
  approach. Programming explicitly with the structural rules does seem like a
  complete pain…but perhaps there are some benefits?

Project question
----------------

By the way, on the semester project, will we have a project proposal process
or should we try to get started once we find a suitable project? And what is
the recommendation on selecting from the course reading materials or should we
try to pick adjacent material not already included on the syllabus?
i.e. should we worry about coordinating the variety of subjects in the class?
A little more guideline/guidance on the project selection would be
appreciated.
