The (course syllabus)[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1i6NLEXnoAy6wkygLAEubdfVrhkF-se07Q6fwoAeTbK4/edit#gid=0] lists
the overall plan of the semester.

## Introduction and course goals

My goal for this course is to extend and deepen your knowledge of programming language theory. This means that we'll start with 
some classic results, but look at them through the lens of modern tools, such as proof assistants. 
Through this course, you should gain a firm foundation for the sorts of proofs that appear in PL research papers, such as in POPL and ICFP, as well as the ability to experiment with new ideas using mechanical proofs.

The syllabus is divided into four parts:
1. Untyped lambda calculus (focusing on Church Rosser Theorem)
2. Simply-typed lambda calculus (Strong normalization, Normalization-by-evaluation)
3. Polymorphism 
4. Effects and Co-effects

## Background 

Everyone in this course should either be a PhD student or have taken CIS 5000.  In
general, we expect that you have experience with functional programming
(Haskell or OCaml), and have seen a type safety proof for simply-typed lambda
calculus.

The first part of the semester will focus on mechanical proofs. As the
semester progresses, we'll shift to more recent results and discuss the proofs
more informally.

## What you should expect this semester

+ If you are taking this class for a grade
  - Come to every class prepared (I'll announce the reading for the next class
  ahead of time)
  - Send me 1-2 questions the morning before each class (via email)
  - Prepare and give one lecture during the semester 
  - Try a few homework problems at the beginning of the semester to make sure
  you are up to speed
  - Complete a semester project (in groups) to go deeper on a particular topic
   * replicate the proofs in a classic paper (by hand or in Coq)
   * extend a classic paper with a new feature
   * some other exploration

+ If you are auditing this semester
   - Come to every class prepared (I'll announce the reading for the next class
     ahead of time)
   - Send me 1-2 questions before each class
